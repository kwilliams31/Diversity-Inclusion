    <h4 id="diversity">Diversity</h4>
    <p> What is diversity? <br>
      Diversity is the state of being diverse. This includes different social and ethnic backgrounds, genders, sexual orientations, etc. (Wiki)

    <h4 id="inclusion">Inclusion</h4>
    <p> Inclusion is the actions taken to creating a diverse community. Being inclusive means allowing equal opportunities, providing resources to marginalized groups. (Wiki)
      
      Ways to be more inclusive:
      <ol>
        <li> Using appropriate and respectful language </li>
        <li> Be aware of your unconscious mind: There can be many reasons why a person has underlying opinions. This can be caused by upbringing, geographic location, etc. Being aware of unconscious thoughts help you become more aware. ex. unconscious bias </li>
  </ol>
  
  Why is it important to be inclusive?
  <br>
  Creating a diverse group comes from the actions of being inclusive. Many people who are apart of marginalized groups just want to accepted and not seen as someone who does not have the same rights as others. It is important to know your own privilege when it comes ot helping these groups. Understanding why these groups feel this way and using your power can help so much.
  <br>
  Allowing these groups to have representation in any context.
  
  <br>
  Questions to ask:
  How do I become more inclusive in my everyday life?
  How do I make sure everyone feels included?

    <h4 id="gay">LGBTQIA+</h4>
    <p>
      To begin, the acronym LGBTQIA+ stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (questioning), intersex, asexual/agender. There are a multitude of terms encompassed within this acronym and the community is not limited to these. 
      
      How can I support this community? Ways can include but not limited to:
      <ol>
        <li> Listening and learning: Taking the time to do these things can mean so much more than you think. Asking how you can help and listening to their advice is an easy step to help create a better relationship. Education is a big part of being an ally and it is not anyones responsibilty but your own. </li>
        <li> Be kind: You don't have to agree with their choices, but you can always be kind. </li>
        
          
  </ol>
      Knowing what words/questions can be harmful:
      <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/">Trevor Project</a>
      This site is a great resource because it not only allows you to explore topics relating to the LGTBTQIA+ community, but they discuss the importance of mental health and provide councelor resources. "Acceptance from at least one adult can decrease the risk of LGBTQ youth attempting suicide by 40%."
      It provides users with terms and their definitions.
